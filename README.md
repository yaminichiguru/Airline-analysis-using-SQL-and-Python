# Airline-analysis-using-SQL-and-Python

## Project Overview
This project is designed to address the current challenges faced by our airline in maintaining profitability amidst rising operational costs, stricter environmental regulations, and a competitive labor market. By analyzing internal data, particularly focusing on occupancy rates and revenue streams, we aim to devise strategies that enhance efficiency and profitability without compromising the quality of service.
Our goal is to leverage data analytics to optimize occupancy rates and increase the average profit per seat, thereby improving overall profitability.

## Data Analysis
We focus on several key metrics to understand and improve our profitability:
- **Aircraft Profitability**: Identifying which aircraft types yield the highest and lowest revenues.
- **Occupancy Rates**: Analyzing seat occupancy rates to adjust pricing and maximize revenue.
- **Pricing Strategies**: Developing dynamic pricing strategies to enhance revenue based on demand and competition.


## Conclusion
Our analysis indicates that by strategically adjusting pricing, optimizing route schedules, and focusing on the most profitable aircraft, we can overcome the financial challenges currently faced. This approach will not only boost profitability but also ensure that customer satisfaction and safety remain high priorities.
